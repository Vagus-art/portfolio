# Personal Todo List

## Projects

### Fullstack
 - "Atrapasue√±os" Flutter app designed to write your dreams and encrypt them with a given password. Flutter frontend and NodeJS or GoLang Backend (hopefully using Microservices Architecture)
 - Maybe instead of dreams it could be a diary
 - **I have to think a way to make a simple REST service that makes sense to non-techie people, something useful in day to day life**

### Backend
 - GoLang/Java monolithic REST api (similar to pg-rest-api)
 - Nodejs/Express/TypeScript Microservices API with Dependency Injection and Clear Architecture. Using Sequelize or Hasura GraphQL. (With Auth) **maybe not, maybe I'll go the Java way**

### Frontend
 - Vue single instance pg-rest-api visualizator (crud) **almost done**
 - Vue CLI pg-rest-api visualizator (crud)
 - React pg-rest-api visualizator (crud)
